        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <l1>6 russet POTATOES</l1>
            <l2>12 strips bacon</l2>
            <l3>1 pound brocolli flour</l3>
            <l4>1 cup diced red bell pepper</l4>
            <l5>half cup water</l5>
            <l6>1 cup sour cream</l6>
            <l7>1 teaspoon salt</l7>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <l1>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</l1>
            <l2>Pierce each potato with a paring knife and roast in the oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes.</l2>
            <l3>Meanwhile, dice up bacon. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and cook bacon until crispy, about 7 minutes. Remove bacon and set aside, leaving bacon fat in the pan.</l3>
            <l4>Return the saute pan with reserved bacon fat to the heat. Cook broccoli and red pepper for 2 minutes. Add water and allow to cook until water has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside.</l4>
            <l5>When potatoes are done cooking, remove and allow to cool enough to handle. Cut them in half and scoop out a portion of the insides with a spoon, leaving about a 1/4-inch border on the skins.</l5>
            <l6>Mix scooped-out potato with 1/2 of the bacon, broccoli-red pepper mixture, sour cream, salt, pepper, and 1/2 of the Cheddar together in a bowl.</l6>
            <l7>Divide the filling and add it back into the potato skins.</l7>
            <l8>Divide the filling and add it back into the potato skins.</l8>
        </ol>
