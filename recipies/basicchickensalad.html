        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Half cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 skinless boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>half cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>half cup balsami</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pierce each potato with a paring knife and roast in the oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, dice up bacon. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and cook bacon until crispy, about 7 minutes. Remove bacon and set aside, leaving bacon fat in the pan.</li>
            <li>Return the saute pan with reserved bacon fat to the heat. Cook broccoli and red pepper for 2 minutes. Add water and allow to cook until water has evaporated. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>When potatoes are done cooking, remove and allow to cool enough to handle. Cut them in half and scoop out a portion of the insides with a spoon, leaving about a 1/4-inch border on the skins.</li>
            <li>Mix scooped-out potato with 1/2 of the bacon, broccoli-red pepper mixture, sour cream, salt, pepper, and 1/2 of the Cheddar together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Divide the filling and add it back into the potato skins.</li>
            <li>Divide the filling and add it back into the potato skins.</li>
